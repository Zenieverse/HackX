HackX is a cutting-edge, decentralized hackathon platform designed to foster innovation, collaboration, and long-term permanence in the developer community. Built with a focus on usability and transparency, HackX leverages InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) to store all critical data—hackathon details, project submissions, developer profiles, feedback, and scores—ensuring a tamper-proof, permanently accessible record. This open-source platform, released under an MIT license, empowers participants, organizers, and judges with intuitive tools while embracing decentralization to eliminate reliance on centralized servers.
Key Features:

Hackathon Discovery: A central hub where users can search, filter, and sort active, upcoming, and past hackathons by keywords, dates, themes, or prizes, with events indexed via IPFS metadata for decentralized access.
Event Details: Comprehensive pages for each hackathon, showcasing overviews, prizes, judges, schedules, and submitted projects, all stored on IPFS for permanence.
Organizer Tools: A multi-step creation flow allows organizers to define events, upload assets to IPFS, and track community engagement, with optional analytics.
Participant Experience: Seamless registration, team formation, and project submission (code, demos, videos) with all assets hosted on IPFS for a persistent developer record.
Project Showcase: A filterable gallery of submissions with community features like upvotes and IPFS-stored comments to encourage interaction.
Judging Workflow: A secure dashboard for judges to review projects, score based on criteria, and submit timestamped feedback, locked by deadlines and stored on IPFS for transparency.
User & Admin Management: Dashboards for participants to manage profiles and submissions, and for admins to moderate events, with IPFS-backed reputation systems.

Vision:
HackX is more than a platform—it's a decentralized ecosystem for builders. It supports team matching, developer reputation tracking, and demo-ready deployments, all while maintaining open-source values with a public GitHub repo and live demo URL. As of September 11, 2025, HackX aims to redefine hackathons by combining futuristic technology with community-driven innovation, making it a go-to hub for developers worldwide.
